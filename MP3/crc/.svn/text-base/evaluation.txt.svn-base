MP3 Performance Evaluation

Part (i):
Generating the data manually took an average of 212 nanoseconds on average 
while the table took only 9 nanoseconds. The table method is far faster yet 
uses a large amount of memory to store all of the values. 

Part (ii):
For p = 10, 7448 out of 8192; 91% detects presence of errors
For p = 20, 7206 out of 8192; 88% detects presence of errors
For p = 30, 7153 out of 8192; 87% detects presence of errors
We can see the amount of errors detected decreases as a bit is more probable
to contain an error. This is because there are too many errors for a CRC length
of three. The CRC needs to be longer to be able to detect more errors.
